Diwali in 2024 will be celebrated on Thursday, November 1st. Diwali, also known as the "Festival of Lights," is one of the most significant festivals in India, 
symbolizing the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when families come together to light oil lamps (diyas), decorate their homes with vibrant rangoli, 
exchange gifts, and enjoy festive meals.

In 2024, the five-day celebration will begin on October 28th with Dhanteras, followed by Narak Chaturdashi (Choti Diwali) on October 31st, 
leading to the main Diwali festival on November 1st. The festivities will continue with Govardhan Puja on November 2nd and end with Bhai Dooj on November 3rd, 
when siblings celebrate their bond.

Diwali is also a time for prayers to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, and Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, for prosperity and happiness in the coming year. 
The vibrant celebrations, marked by fireworks and feasts, make it a cherished festival across the world.
